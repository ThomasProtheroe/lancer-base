Done
-Downtime "units" usable by pilots for construction/production etc.
-Display log file contents on a sidebar so pilots can see who did what
-Ability to print mechs. Subtract resource costs and randomly generate any flaws/qualities.

In Progress


Planned
-GM interface to hand out downtime units and create new addons
-Requirements for addons to be purchasable. ie tier 2 printer needed for tier 3 printer to be visible.

Would be Cool
-Login system of some kind for pilots
-Mech hanger. List of all printed mechs by the team, tagged with an owner
